# DA5401 A8: Ensemble Learning for Complex Regression Modeling on Bike Share Data
**Name:** Samyam Rishika  
**Roll Number:** CE22B101  

---

## Project Overview
This assignment addresses the problem of predicting hourly bike rental counts using ensemble learning. Single models like Decision Trees or Linear Regression often struggle to capture the complex, non-linear patterns in the data, leading to high bias or variance.

We implement and evaluate advanced ensemble techniques, including Bagging, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking, to achieve optimal prediction accuracy.

The Stacking Regressor combines multiple base learners through a meta-learner, leveraging model diversity to minimize both bias and variance.
